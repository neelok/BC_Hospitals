## Motivation
The main motivation behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate Hospitals in BC along with Addresses and Other contact Details

## Data:
Data for the blood bank application is sourced from [BRITISH COLUMBIA DATA CATALOGUE](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/hospitals-in-bc). The original data is available as a csv file called "hlbc_hospitals (updated Till 28th April)". 

SourceCode of the App is locaded on [GitHub](https://github.com/neelok/BC_Hospitals)



## Data limitation
One of the limitations of this application is that few of the Phone numbers are missing. 
I am in a process to update these points.

## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map is incorrect and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email me and i will update the same.
